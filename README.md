# Deep-Learning-Baseline

## Overview
This is a Baseline that can be transferred to the training of most deep learning neural network

It can be used to check the loss value on validation set during training process

Visualization shows the change in loss value between the training set and the validation set during training process

Supports multiple optimizers:
* SGD
* Momentum
* RMSprop
* Adam

## Runtime Environment
* PyTorch
* matplotlib
