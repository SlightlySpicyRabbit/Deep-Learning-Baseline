# Deep-Learning-Baseline

## Overview
This is a Baseline that can be transferred to the training of most deep learning neural network. There are multiple optimizers to choose:

Supports multiple optimizers:
* SGD
* Momentum
* RMSprop
* Adam

It can be used to check the loss value on validation set during training process

Visualization shows the change in loss value between the training set and the validation set during training process

## Runtime Environment
PyTorch
matplotlib
